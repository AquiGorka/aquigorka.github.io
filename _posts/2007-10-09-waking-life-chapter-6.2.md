You can’t fight city hall, death and taxes.
<br />
Don’t talk about politics or religion.
<br />
This is all the equivalent of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line.
<br />
Lay down, G.I.
<br />
Lay down, G.I.
<br />
We saw it all through the 20th Century.
<br />
And now in the 21st Century it’s time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed into this rat maze.
<br />
We should not submit to dehumanization.
<br />
I don’t know about you, but I’m concerned with what’s happening in this world.
<br />
I’m concerned with the structure.
<br />
I’m concerned with the systems of control, those that control my life and those that seek to control it even more.
<br />
I want freedom!
<br />
That’s what I want!
<br />
And that’s what you should want!
<br />
It’s up to each and every one of us to turn loose and just shovel the greed, the hatred the envy and, yes, the insecurities because that is the central mode of control: make us feel pathetic, small, so we’ll givingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our destiny.
<br />
We have got to realize that we’re being conditioned on a mass scale.
<br />
Start challenging this corporate slave state!
<br />
The 21st Century is gonna be a new century, not the century of slavery, not the century of lies and issues of no significance and classism and statism and all the rest of the modes of control!
<br />
It’s gonna be the age of humanikind standing up for something pure and something right!
<br />
What a bunch of garbage: liberal Democrat, conservative Republican.
<br />
It’s all there to control you.
<br />
Two sides of the same coin.
<br />
Two management teams bidding for control!
<br />
The C.E.O. job of Slavery, Incorporated!
<br />
The truth is out there in front of you, but they lay out this buffet of lies!
<br />
I’m sick of it, and I’m not gonna take a bite out of it! Do you got me?
<br />
Resistance is not futile.
<br />
We’re gonna win this thing.
<br />
Humankind is too good!
<br />
We’re not a bunch of underachievers!
<br />
We’re gonna stand up and we’re gonna be human beings!
<br />
We’re gonna get fired up about the real things, the things that matter: creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
<br />
Well, that’s it! That’s all I got to say! It’s in your court.

Cheers,<br />
Gorka
