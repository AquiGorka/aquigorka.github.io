I believe in crowd source because there is no “one man superhero” with all the answers, questions or solutions.

Some people might have the questions to our searchings/explorations/knowledge but if we never get the question, the solution will stay buried within ourselves.

<p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Digital socialism is socialism without the state</p>

>...When masses of people who own the means of production work toward a common goal and share their products in common, when they contribute labor without wages and enjoy the fruits free of charge, it’s not unreasonable to call that socialism...
